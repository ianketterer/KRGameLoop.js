KRGameLoop.js
=============

Javascript Game Loop for Canvas / HTML5. 

This is a simple canvas animation script that allows you to 
manage multiple animations movements simultaneously. It also 
has templates for initializing an animated parallax scroller, 
and manages user mouse click input...

very easy and straight forward routine calls, and well annotated code.
